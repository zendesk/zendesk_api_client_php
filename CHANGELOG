Changed:

* on tickets, can no longer do $client->tickets(["organization_id" -> 1231])->findAll(), etc. (also user_id)
* separate findMany method
* change interface of find to just take ID, then params
* added updateMany method, support both ways of updating
* change update so that it takes ID as first param
* change delete so that it takes id
* add deleteMany method to tickets
* Add property chained properties to store all previous chained calls
* Removed setting of last ID on instantiation of Resource
* Allowed pattern `$client->ticket(id)->find()` for consistency with chaining pattern
* Make $id in delete and update optional to allow passing of the id via chaining pattern
